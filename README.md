An organisation dedicated to building the tools to help grow a thriving maker movement in NZ.

## Define our understanding of maker movement

## Goals for MoNZ
"Our ambition forMoNZ is that it can be a super effective organisation, where makers relate to each other based on collaboration, rather than holding power over each other.

We're looking to co-create this collaborative organisation together, participatory governance processes like these are critically important."
